Presentation and demo assets for my "Browser Tools for Debugging and Profit" presentation.
This is very related to my "Debugging JavaScript" presentation which I might just kill and use
this instead.

You can find the slide deck (reveal.js based) in preso.
You can find demos in ... wait for it... demos.
